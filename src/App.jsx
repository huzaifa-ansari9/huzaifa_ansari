            <p>
              First, thank you for taking the time to read my story. When I was
              10 years old, I had difficulty breathing because one of my
              nostrils was blocked. My father took me to a doctor who, after
              examining me, asked us to follow him. We were taken into an
              operation room (Operation Theatre). I was shocked and scared â€” it
              was the first time I had seen such a place. My father came in with
              me. The doctor asked me to lie down on the bed, and although I was
              frightened, I had no choice.
            </p>

            <p>
              I sat on the bed and started crying. As a 10-year-old, everything
              was unfamiliar to me â€” the lights, equipment, and even the smell.
              My father tried to calm me, but I couldn't stop crying. The doctor
              wanted to use a microscopic camera to examine my nose and mouth.
              After the checkup, he started a casual conversation with me.{" "}
              <span className="text-[#ffa500]">
                Then suddenly, he asked, "What do you want to become in the
                future?"
              </span>{" "}
              I replied,{" "}
              <span className="text-[#ffa500]">
                "I want to become a GREAT SCIENTIST."
              </span>{" "}
              At the time, I didnâ€™t fully understand what I said, but day by
              day, I grew into{" "}
              <span className="text-[#ffa500]">
                one of the youngest tech enthusiasts.
              </span>
            </p>

            <p>
              I am very thankful to my father, who has always supported me. Now
              at 16, I can proudly say that{" "}
              <span className="text-[#ffa500]">
                I have the level of software engineering knowledge that a
